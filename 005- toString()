toString():
  
    - It is a method used to return object values as Strings.
    - It is a String representation of an object.
    - Java internally calls toString() method when an object is created.
    
    
CODE:

package tostring;
class Employee{
    int id;
    String name;
    String place;
    Employee(int id,String name,String place){
        this.id=id;
        this.name=name;
        this.place=place;
        
    }
    public String toString(){
        return id+" "+name+" "+place;
    }
}
public class ToString {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        Employee e1=new Employee(1,"Sasi","Pondy");
        Employee e2=new Employee(2,"Kumar","Chennai");
        System.out.println(e1+"\n"+e2);
    }
    
}

OUTPUT:

1 Sasi Pondy
2 Kumar Chennai

*In the above code toString() is automaticallly called by JVM internally.
